# yinarlingi <img src="man/figures/yinarlingi.png" align="right" width="100px" />

## Overview

The purpose of yinarlingi is to provide a set of convenience functions for validating Warlpiri dictionary data. Essentially, it pre-configures various functions from [tidylex](https://coedl.github.io/tidylex/) and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages with values specific to the Warlpiri dictionary data, so that those within the Warlpiri dictionary project can quickly run and re-run frequently used routines (e.g. data validation, derived views), and also so that these tests can be run in a Continuous Testing (CT) environment such as GitLab pipelines.

Yinarlingi is a Warlpiri word for echidna.

## Installation

You can install yinarlingi from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CoEDL/yinarlingi")
```

## Examples

### Read in the Warlpiri lexicon into a data frame

The Warlpiri dictionary consists of a large plain text file of the form (where `\me` stands for main entry; see [full list of codes](https://github.com/CoEDL/yinarlingi/blob/master/inst/structures/wlp_code-definitions.csv)):

```
\me jampaly(pa) (N) (PV): (La,Wi,Y)
\dm spatial: tactile: \edm
\gl sharp, pointed \egl
\rv sharp \erv
\eg
\we Karlangu ka karri jampalypa ngulaju yiri-nyayirni. \[@@]
\et The digging stick is sharp, that is very sharp pointed. \ewe
\eeg
\ant jampilypa, munju \eant
\cf jaarn-karri-mi, lirra jampalypa \ecf
\syn jalkarra, larrilpi, yiri \esyn
\eme
\sse jampaly-pi-nyi (V):
\def xERG cause y to come to be sharp (<jampalypa>) \edef
\gl sharpen, trim to ^point \egl
\rv sharpen \erv
\eg
\we Jampaly-pungulpalu wangkinypa, yangka kuja munju-jarrija. \[@@]
\et They sharpened the stone-axe which had became blunt. \ewe
\we Karlangulu jampalypa-pungu. \[Tiger Jakamarra]
\et They sharpened the points of the digging sticks. \ewe
\eeg
\csl YSL#1336, YSL#313 \ecsl
\syn yiri-ma-ni \esyn
\esse

...
```

We can use the `read_wlp_lexicon` function to read such data into a data frame:

```{r read-mini-lexicon}
library(yinarlingi)

# Yinarlingi provides a 'mini lexicon' with a few entries as extra data
# Use system.file to locate the path to this file in your local computer
lexicon_path <- system.file("extdata/wlp-lexicon_mini.txt", package = "yinarlingi")

read_wlp_lexicon(lexicon_path)
```

We can see that this is the exact same result as calling the `read_lexicon` function from the tidylex package:

```{r tidylex-demo}
library(tidylex)

read_lexicon(
    file  = lexicon_path,
    regex = "^\\\\([a-z]+)",
    into  = "code1"
)
```

### Test that Warlpiri dictionary entry data lines are well-ordered

The a well-structured Warlpiri entry is defined as a [Nearley](https://nearley.js.org/) grammar (see full grammar [here](https://github.com/CoEDL/yinarlingi/blob/master/inst/structures/wlp_skeleton-simple.ne)), of which a snippet is shown below:

```nearley
entryBody       -> "org":? "dm":* "def":? "lat":? "gl":? "rv":? "cm":*
                      (exampleBlock:+ | paradigmExample:+):?
                      crossRefs
```

We can see here that a semantic domain line `dm` must come *before* the gloss line `gl`. So, the following data (provided in `wlp-lexicon_invalid-sequence.txt`) clearly does not satisfy this requirement:

<pre>
\me jampaly(pa) (N) (PV): (La,Wi,Y)
<span style="color:red">\gl sharp, pointed \egl</span>
\dm spatial: tactile: \edm
...
</pre>

Such data are caught by the `test_code1_ordered` function (notice `code1_ok` is `FALSE` on the third line):

```{r test-invalid-data}
invalid_lexicon_path <- system.file("extdata/wlp-lexicon_invalid-sequence.txt", package = "yinarlingi")

read_wlp_lexicon(invalid_lexicon_path) %>%
    test_code1_ordered()
```
